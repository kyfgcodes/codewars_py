import re
'''In this kata, your task is to create a regular expression capable of evaluating binary strings (strings with only 1s and 0s) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by 3.

Take into account that:

An empty string might be evaluated to true (it's not going to be tested, so you don't need to worry about it - unless you want)
The input should consist only of binary digits - no spaces, other digits, alphanumeric characters, etc.
There might be leading 0s.'''

pattern = re.compile(r'[0-1]^[a-zA-Z]')
